#Tag Prediction 

##Set up
* download data csv files [here](http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/data).

##Algorithm
* My solution is based on [Alex Minnaar's blog post](http://alexminnaar.com/2013/09/14/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction-part-1/).
* I will go on the improvements in the following days.

##Instructions
* In fact, the dataset is orginally used for Keyword Extraction task, which I treated as a simple tag prediction transforming into classification problem. 
* The Keyword Extraction task can be intuitively solved by creating tags directly from the texts, using lexicon methods. But, I will not include this in this repository.
